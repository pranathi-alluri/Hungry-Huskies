# Hungry-Huskies

Hungry Huskies is a platform that allows Northeastern students to search, rate, read and write
reviews for restaurants within a 0.6 mile radius of Northeastern University.
They can also create a collection, or a list, of restaurants that they enjoy to share with others, making finding a place to eat easier than ever!
